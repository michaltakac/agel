# Threat-model evolution

Each release records newly reachable attack surfaces and the invariant that
contains them.

## v0.5

- **Staged source:** proposals may be malformed, stale, effectful, or authored
  by a compromised model. The external verifier binds source and base digests,
  denies undeclared effects, runs without authority, and atomically promotes.
- **Time travel after external effects:** rollback may restore pending language
  state. A monotonic effect journal outside that state prevents a second claim.
- **Restored bearer authority:** snapshot restore invalidates existing handles
  by advancing the capability epoch.
- **Forged completion:** completions are bound to a world/request/provider/
  prompt-derived effect key.

The verifier is a deterministic gate, not a theorem prover. Unknown semantic
behavior is constrained by zero-authority canaries and executable tests; later
releases add stronger effect interposition and model checking.

## v0.6

- **Ambient host authority:** a child process could inherit credentials or an
  attacker-controlled environment. The process boundary clears the environment
  and restores only a short, named login/configuration allowlist.
- **Arbitrary execution:** an effect request cannot select a different binary;
  the exact executable must have been allowlisted when its provider was enabled.
- **Runaway tools:** wall-clock and captured-output limits are enforced, and a
  timed-out Unix child process group is terminated.
- **Unreviewed filesystem mutation:** proposed file changes can live in a
  copy-on-write overlay, be inspected as a deterministic diff, then explicitly
  committed or discarded. Virtual paths reject parent traversal.
- **Invisible effects:** every process allow/deny and terminal outcome receives
  a SHA-256-bound typed intent and is visible through the provider audit log and
  the REPL's `:effects` command.

This is userspace interposition, not a complete sandbox against malicious native
code. Today the trusted Rust host can call operating-system APIs outside this
crate, and provider safety additionally relies on each CLI's own read-only or
restricted mode. Native syscall mediation, mount/network policy, quotas across
process descendants, and a separate supervisor remain required before Agel can
run hostile machine code.
